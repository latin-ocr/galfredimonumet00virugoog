ι isso, ano nso sy Micnelannwsgn, svo. Paris, 1837.

l As the last of these three works has been so recently
y publishcd, in a size corresponding with the present vo-
* lume, and further, asit is certainly nota genuine work
' of Geoffrey of Monmonth, wc have not thought it desir-
; able to repeat it in this edition ; but the Historyof the

Britons (including the Propheoy of Merlin) is too valna-

χ ble a record to be* suffered to remain any longer without
’ being placed in a convenient form before the student of

ὲ English History.

The series of our Chroniclers may, it is true, be eon-
sidered as complete without the addition of this work.
Itis not for historical accuracy that the book before us

y is valuable3 for the great mass of scholars have come

to the decided conviction that it is full of fables. But
, it is the romantio character which pervadas the nar-
rative, together with its acknowledged antiquity, which
make it desirable that the book should not sink into ob-
livion. Those who desire to possess it as evenerable
relic of an early age, will now have an opportunity of
gratifying their wish; whilst others, who despise it as
valueless, in their researehes after historic truth, may,
nevertheless, find some little pleasure in the {tales of
'imagination which it contains.

Ι In the present edition, the text hasbeen oarefully
revised, and in each particular case‚that reading has been

chosen which appeared to be the best ; but alterations
of the text, founded on conjecture and adopted in haste,
have been scdulously abstained from. The manuscripts
of this author are very numerous, and the work is con-

’ ’ sequently preserved to us more correct than is generally

the ease with such old writers In the British Mu-
seum alone there are no less than thirty manuscripts
