Of the Haterio Britoccm there are two previous
editions; the latter of which, hy Oommehn, is contained
in a volume, entitled Rerum Britannicarum, id eet

is much superior to theformer, by Ascensius, published
at PariS, in lto. 1508, reprinted 1517, which ahounds
with abbreviatione, that sometimes throw ambiguity over
the meaning, and divides the work into seven books only.

The Prophetic Mcrltni is found in both the editions
of fflotmioBritoncm, and was also published separately,
together with a learned commentary, by Alanus de
Insulia [ssvo. Francofurti,1608.]

Those who admire the poetical legenda, oi Wales will
feel an interest in these propheciae, which served so
often to stir up the Welsh to war against the English ;
and by the false hopes with which they inspired Llewel·
lyn, led that gallant and ill-fated prince to his own
destruction.

The Vita Martini was published with the Prophecies
by the Roxburgh Olub, ed. W. H. Black, 4t0.L0n‹10n,
