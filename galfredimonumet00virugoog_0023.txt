honourable mention, being a man very curious in the
study of antiquity, and a diligent searoher into ancient
libraries, and especially after the works of ancient
authore, happened while he was in Armorica to light
upon a History of Britain, written in the British
tongue, and carrying marks of great antiquity. And
being overjoyed at it, as if he had found a vast
treasure, he in a short time after came over to
Englaud3 where enquiring for a proper person to
translate this curicus but hitherto unknown book,
he very opportunely met with Geoffrey of Moumouth,
a man profoundly versed in the history and antiquities
of Britain, excellently skilled in the British longae,
and withal (considering the tima) an elegant writer
both in verse and prose; and so recommended this
task to him. Accordingly, Geoffrey, being incredibly
delighted with this ancient book, undertook the trans-
lating of it into Latin, which he performed with great
diligence, approving himself, according to Matthew
Paris, a faithful translator. At first he divided it into
four books, written in a plain simple style, and dedi-
cated it to Robert, earl of Gloueester‚ a copy whereof
is said* to be at Bennet Oollege, in Cambridge, which
was never, yet published; but afterwards he made
some, alterations and divided it into eight boola, to
which he added the Book of Merlin's Propheeies,
which, he had also translated from British verse into
Latin prose, prefixing to, it a Preface, and a Letter to
Alexander, Bishop of Lineoln. A great many fabulous
and trifling stories are inserted in the History: but that
was not his fault3 his business as a translator was to

t See Pitts and Voss.
