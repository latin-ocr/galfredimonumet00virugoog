3 ignorante of the Welsh tongue rendere me unqualified

for making any search into these matters3 and though

, the search should be attended with never so much
l satisfaction, to those who are ableto judge of⁴ the
antiquity of manuscripts, yet to the generality of

readers, other arguments would perhaps be more

j eonvinoing.''

The passages which we have here quoted at length,

' will furnish the most ample information conceruing
κ the nature of the question, and it only remeius to
³ inform the reader what is my own opinion on this
¹ long-agitated literary controversy.

To those who have read tho plain and simple state-

ments of Julius Caesar and the other Classis Historians
' who have described the early state of Britain, it will
, be morally certam that all such accounts of ansar’s
¹ invasion as we find in Geoffrey of Monmouth are purely

fabulous.

Tho uncertainty of every thing save the bare facts
connected with the siege of Troy, is so great, that to
connect its fortunas with those of a distant and at that
time unheard-of island like Britain, can be admissible ·
only in the pages of romanoe.

But in the latter part of the work which contains the
history of Britain, during its conquests and oivihzation
by the Romans, we may possibly find the germs of
facts, unnoticed elsewhere. ,

This statement does not militate against the veracity
of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who may readily be allowed
to have translated the volume, as he professes to have
done, out of the British language: but whether any
ancient MSS. of this history still remain, is a point
which has not yet been ascertained.
