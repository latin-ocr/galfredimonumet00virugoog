deliver them faithfully such as they were, aad leave
them to the judgment of the learned to be discussed.

“ To prove the truth of this relation, and to answer
at once all objections against Geoffrey's integrity, one
needs no other argument than an assurance that the
original manuscript which Gcoffrey translated, of
whose antiquity the carious are able to jndge in a -
great measure by the character, or any ancient and
authentic copy of it, is yet extant. And indeed,
Archbishop Usher† mentions an old Welsh Chronicle
in the Cottonian Library, that formerly was in the
possession of that learned antiquary, Humphrey
Lhwyd, which he says is thought to be that which
Geoffrey translated. But if that be the original manu-
script, it must be acknowledged that Geoffrey was not
merely a translator, but made some additions of his
own; since, as that most learned prelate informs us,
the account that we have in this History of the British
Flamens and Archflamens, is nowhere to be found in
it. But besides thie, there are several copies oi it in
the Welsh tongue, mentioned by the late ingenious and
learned Mr. Lhwyd in his ‘Archaeologia Britannica)
And I myself have met with a manuscript History of ἵ
our British Affairs, written above a hundred years
ago by Mr. John Lewis, and shortly to be published,
wherein the author sayS, that he had the originales i
the British History m parchment written m the British ς
tougue before Geoffrey's time, as he concludes from
this circumstance, that m his book Geoffrey’s Preface ¹
was wanting, and the Preface to his book was the
second ch'apter of that published by Geoffrey. My ,
