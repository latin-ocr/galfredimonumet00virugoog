If no other-arguments could be adduoed to prove

the utter incredibility of the earlier parts of this =

history, the following Ohronologieal Tahle would

furnish sufficient arguments to establish it, hy the Ἴ

extraordinsry anachronisms which it contains

For instance, between the reigns of Brutus end
Leil, is an interval of 156 years; yet Geoffrey makes
the capture of the Ark contemporaneous with the reign
of Brutus, and the building of Solomon’s temple with
that of Leil. Now the interval between these two
events cannot by any possibility he extended beyond
eighty years. lt is, moreover, impossible to bring the
chronology of the British kings themselves into harmony
with the <lates before Christ, as there is no mention
made of the exact interval between the taking of Troy
end Brutus’s landing in Britain.

Geoffrey inscribes his work to Robert, Esrl of
Gloueester, son of Henry the senone-(1. 1.)
