of which seven are in the Oottonlan Oollection, eight in
the Arundelian, seven in the King’s Library, and eight
in the Harleian. Alarge number of manuscripts have .
been either wholly or in part collated for this edition ;
and a list of them will be found at the end of the vo·
lume; but, except in two or three instances, where a
whole sentence has been replaced, and in others where
the corrections are so decided as to leave no doubt
which reading ought to be preferred, the variatione are
so trifling that ithae been dcemcd superfluous to notice ¹
them. ' ’
That nothing might be wanting, in these new edi-
tions of our ancient historiam, we have added to this
volume the ahridgment of Geoffrey of Monmouth by
PonticusVirunnius Tarvisinus‚whodied 1520. Among ·
the Arundel Mss, in the British Museum, are trans-
latione, hythe same author, of Theophilus Protospa÷
tharius de Urinis aud Philerctus de Pulsibus, which of
course are of no velue. Even his British History is of
little importance‚ as it is generally amere copy of (leof-
frey of Monmouth, and frequently in almost the same
words ; hut, in oue or two instances, he has departed
from this uniformity, and introduces afew observatione
of his own. It has, moreover, been thought desirable
to retain him in this place, in order that the whole of
the Heidelberg Scriptores Rerum Britannicarum might
be reprinted, and nothing omitted which might render
it necessary for the reader to purchase the old edition
likewise. The work of Ponticus Virrunnius hasbeen
twice published separately, in small 8vo. Aug. Vin.
1534, and again per D. Povelum S. Theol. Profess
Londini, 1585. In the latter is found a Catalogus

Regum less full than that given in this volume.
